# Example Web App to create and deploy an NFT collectible smart contract  

## Motivation for the project
- I wanted to teach myself more of Web3 functionality, and practice more skills outside my current skillset as a Data Scientist and Data Engineer. Pretty simple. 

## Why did you build this project?
- See answer above. I wanted to prove to myself that I can learn this stuff!

## What problem does it solve?
- None really; the technology in this project already exists. This is my way of "getting up to speed" on the existing Web3 technology.

## What did you learn 
- Almost everything in this project is new to me. From the libraries to the Solarity language. I followed many guides to assemble this project, and dont plan to productionize any of it. 

## How to use the Project
